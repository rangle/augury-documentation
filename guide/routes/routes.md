## Description

The _Routes_ Angular application demonstrates the uses of _routes_ as well as lazy loaded child routes. The application also makes use of multiple _router outlets_.

The application contains 10 components and 2 modules. The _root_ module `app.module.ts` contains the following components:

* AppComponent
* HomeComponent
* ParksComponent
* ParkOneComponent
* ParkTwoComponent
* ParkThreeComponent

The _city_ module `city.module.ts` contains:

* CityComponent
* CityOneComponent
* CityTwoComponent
* CityThreeComponent

## Architecture

The component code is simple, the `AppComponent` has a single router outlet. When the `ParksComponent` or `CityComponent` component is loaded, a second router outlet becomes available. Components from the child route get loaded into the second router outlet.

The _root_ module `app.module.ts` provides routes for _root_ and _parks_, which are:

Routes|Component (View)
------|---------
`/`|AppComponent
`/home`|HomeComponent
`/parks`|ParksComponent
`/parks/park1`|ParkOneComponent
`/parks/park2`|ParkTwoComponent
`/parks/park3`|ParkThreeComponent

The root path `/` gets redirected to `/home`. Also the lazy loaded route for `cities` is defined in the _root_ module.

The city module `city.module.ts` contains the routes for _cities_ below:

Routes|Component (View)
------|---------
`/cities/city1`|CityOneComponent
`/cities/city2`|CityTwoComponent
`/cities/city3`|CityThreeComponent

## Opening Augury

To use Augury, we need to open DevTools.

```
Ctrl + Shift + I (Cmd + Opt + I on Mac)
```

When DevTools opens, select the _Augury_ tab located on the far right.

## Router outlet

With Augury opened, in the _Component Tree_ `AppComponent` shows `router-outlet` as a child element, this makes sense since it is declared in the _template_.

In the browser, click on the _Parks_ button. This will load the `ParksComponent` and update the _Component Tree_ view. You will notice a second `router-outlet` that appears under `ParksComponent`, this is where each of the park components will load into.

Try clicking on each of the links labeled:

* Park 1
* Path 2
* Park 3

Notice how each child component is loaded under `ParksComponent` just underneath `router-outlet`. This is how Angular inserts a component into the DOM, as a sibling element of `router-outlet`.

## Routes

To see the current _routes_ for the application, click on the _Router Tree_ tab. This will show all the defined routes that are currently loaded in the application. The routes shows the path to each component (think view). The `AppComponent` path is the root `/`. The path to `HomeComponent` is `/home`, likewise the path to the child component `ParkThreeComponent` is `/parks/park3`.

Take a look at the bottom of the router tree, you will notice `cities [Lazy]`, this is a lazy loaded route. This means that the child components for the path `/cities` will be loaded on demand, this takes place when the _Cities_ button is clicked. Let us see this in action, click on the _Cities_ button and pay attention to how the _lazy route_ is updated when the feature Angular module is loaded.

That is all there is to Angular routes. We have looked at `router-outlet`, router tree and how it represents the path to the view and finally noticing lazy loaded routes.
